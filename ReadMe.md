A HTML, CSS, and JavaScript guessing game for the PerScholas SBA 316 on the Document Object Model. This project uses functions, query selectors, and event listeners to randomly choose a word from a given array, dynamically create and add the necessary number of boxes corresponding to the number of words, and update the guessed letters, guesses left, and letters inside the boxes whenever the user clicks submit or enter.
